      Packages has since it was introduced more than 5 years ago been an 
      experimental feature. Use it at your own risk, we do not
      actively maintain and develop this feature. It might however be 
      supported some 
      day.
      </p>
      <p>
	In spite of this packages work quite well, but there are some 
	known issues in tools and other parts where packages don't work well.

    <p>
  <em>Introduction</em>
</p>
    <p>Packages are simply namespaces for modules. 
      All old Erlang modules automatically belong to the top level 
      ("empty-string") namespace, and do not need any changes.</p>
    <p>The full name of a packaged module is written as e.g. 
      "<tt>fee.fie.foe.foo</tt>",
      i.e., as atoms separated by periods, 
      where the package name is the part up to
      but not including the last period; 
      in this case "<tt>fee.fie.foe</tt>".
      A more concrete example is the module <tt>erl.lang.term</tt>, 
      which is in the
      package <tt>erl.lang</tt>. 
      Package names can have any number of segments, as in 
      <tt>erl.lang.list.sort</tt>.
      The atoms in the name can be quoted, as in <tt>foo.'Bar'.baz</tt>, 
      or even the
      whole name, as in <tt>'foo.bar.baz'</tt> but the concatenation of 
      atoms and
      periods must not contain two consecutive period characters or 
      end with a period,
      as in <tt>'foo..bar'</tt>, <tt>foo.'.bar'</tt>, or <tt>foo.'bar.'</tt>. 
      The periods must not be followed by whitespace.</p>
    <p>The code loader maps module names onto the file system directory 
      structure.
      E.g., the module <tt>erl.lang.term</tt> corresponds to a file 
      <tt>.../erl/lang/term.beam</tt>
      in the search path. 
      Note that the name of the actual object file corresponds to
      the last part only of the full module name. 
      (Thus, old existing modules such as <tt>lists</tt>
      simply map to <tt>.../lists.beam</tt>, exactly as before.)</p>
    <p>A packaged module in a file "<tt>foo/bar/fred.erl</tt>" is declared
      as:</p>
    <pre>
-module(foo.bar.fred).</pre>
    <p>This can be compiled and loaded from the Erlang shell using 
      <tt>c(fred)</tt>, if
      your current directory is the same as that of the file. 
      The object file will be named <tt>fred.beam</tt>.</p>
    <p>The Erlang search path works exactly as before, 
      except that the package segments will be appended to each 
      directory in the path in order to find the
      file. E.g., assume the path is <tt>["/usr/lib/erl", "/usr/local/lib/otp/legacy/ebin", "/home/barney/erl"]</tt>.
      Then, the code for a module named <tt>foo.bar.fred</tt> will be 
      searched for
      first as <tt>"/usr/lib/erl/foo/bar/fred.beam"</tt>, then 
      <tt>"/usr/local/lib/otp/legacy/ebin/foo/bar/fred.beam"</tt>
      and lastly <tt>"/home/barney/erl/foo/bar/fred.beam"</tt>. 
      A module
      like <tt>lists</tt>, which is in the top-level package, 
      will be looked for as <tt>"/usr/lib/erl/lists.beam"</tt>,
      <tt>"/usr/local/lib/otp/legacy/ebin/lists.beam"</tt> and 
      <tt>"/home/barney/erl/lists.beam"</tt>.</p>
    <p>
  <em>Programming</em>
</p>
    <p>Normally, if a call is made from one module to another, 
      it is assumed that the
      called module belongs to the same package as the source module. 
      The compiler
      automatically expands such calls. E.g., in:</p>
    <pre>
-module(foo.bar.m1).
-export([f/1]).

f(X) -&gt; m2:g(X).</pre>
    <p><tt>m2:g(X)</tt> becomes a call to <tt>foo.bar.m2</tt>
      If this is not what was intended, the call can be written 
      explicitly, as in</p>
    <pre>
-module(foo.bar.m1).
-export([f/1]).

f(X) -&gt; fee.fie.foe.m2:g(X).</pre>
    <p>Because the called module is given with an explicit package name, 
      no expansion is done in this case.</p>
    <p>If a module from another package is used repeatedly in a module, 
      an import declaration can make life easier:</p>
    <pre>
-module(foo.bar.m1).
-export([f/1, g/1]).
-import(fee.fie.foe.m2).

f(X) -&gt; m2:g(X).
g(X) -&gt; m2:h(X).</pre>
    <p>will make the calls to <tt>m2</tt> refer to <tt>fee.fie.foe.m2</tt>. 
      More generally, a declaration <tt>-import(Package.Module).</tt> 
      will cause calls to <tt>Module</tt>
      to be expanded to <tt>Package.Module</tt>.</p>
    <p>Old-style function imports work as normal (but full module 
      names must be
      used); e.g.:</p>
    <pre>
-import(fee.fie.foe.m2, [g/1, h/1]).</pre>
    <p>however, it is probably better to avoid this form of import 
      altogether in new
      code, since it makes it hard to see what calls are really "remote".</p>
    <p>If it is necessary to call a module in the top-level package 
      from within a
      named package, the module name can be written either with an 
      initial period as
      in e.g. "<tt>.lists</tt>", or with an empty initial atom, as in 
      "<tt>''.lists</tt>".
      However, the best way is to use an import declaration - 
      this is most obvious to
      the eye, and makes sure we don't forget adding a period somewhere:</p>
    <pre>
-module(foo.bar.fred).
-export([f/1]).
-import(lists).

f(X) -&gt; lists:reverse(X).</pre>
    <p>The dot-syntax for module names can be used in any expression. 
      All segments must
      be constant atoms, and the result must be a well-formed 
      package/module name.
      E.g.:</p>
    <pre>
spawn(foo.bar.fred, f, [X])</pre>
    <p>is equivalent to <tt>spawn('foo.bar.fred', f, [X])</tt>.</p>
    <p>
  <em>The Erlang Shell</em>
</p>
    <p>The shell also automatically expands remote calls, 
      however currently no
      expansions are made by default. 
      The user can change the behaviour by using the <tt>import/1</tt>
      shell command (or its abbreviation <tt>use/1</tt>). E.g.:</p>
    <pre>
1&gt; <tt>import(foo.bar.m).</tt><br/>
ok
2&gt; <tt>m:f().</tt><br/></pre>
    <p>will evaluate <tt>foo.bar.m:f()</tt>. 
      If a new import is made of the same name,
      this overrides any previous import. 
      (It is likely that in the future, some
      system packages will be pre-imported.)</p>
    <p>In addition, the shell command <tt>import_all/1</tt> 
      (and its alias <tt>use_all/1</tt>)
      imports all modules currently found in the path for a given 
      package name. E.g.,
      assuming the files "<tt>.../foo/bar/fred.beam</tt>", 
      "<tt>.../foo/bar/barney.beam</tt>"
      and "<tt>.../foo/bar/bambam.beam</tt>" can be found from our current
      path,</p>
    <pre>
1&gt; <tt>import_all(foo.bar).</tt><br/></pre>
    <p>will make <tt>fred</tt>, <tt>barney</tt> and <tt>bambam</tt> 
      expand to <tt>foo.bar.fred</tt>,
      <tt>foo.bar.barney</tt> and <tt>foo.bar.bambam</tt>, respectively.</p>
    <p>Note: The compiler does not have an "import all" directive, for the
      reason that Erlang has no compile time type checking. 
      E.g. if the wrong search
      path is used at compile time, a call <tt>m:f(...)</tt> 
      could be expanded to <tt>foo.bar.m:f(...)</tt>
      without any warning, instead of the intended 
      <tt>frob.ozz.m:f(...)</tt>, if
      package <tt>foo.bar</tt> happens to be found first in the path. 
      Explicitly
      declaring each use of a module makes for safe code.</p>
