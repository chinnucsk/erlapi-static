    <p><tt>disk_log</tt> is a disk based term logger which makes
      it possible to efficiently log items on files. 
      Two types of logs are supported,
      <em>halt logs</em> and <em>wrap logs</em>. A halt log
      appends items to a single file, the size of which may or may
      not be limited by the disk log module, whereas a wrap log utilizes
      a sequence of wrap log files of limited size. As a wrap log file
      has been filled up, further items are logged onto to the next 
      file in the sequence, starting all over with the first file when 
      the last file has been filled up. For the sake of efficiency, 
      items are always written to files as binaries.
      </p>
    <p>Two formats of the log files are supported, the <em>internal format</em> and the <em>external format</em>. The internal
      format supports automatic repair of log files that have not been
      properly closed, and makes it possible to efficiently read
      logged items in <em>chunks</em> using a set of functions defined
      in this module. In fact, this is the only way to read internally
      formatted logs. The external format leaves it up to the user to
      read the logged deep byte lists. The disk log module cannot
      repair externally formatted logs. An item logged to an
      internally formatted log must not occupy more than 4 GB of disk
      space (the size must fit in 4 bytes).
      </p>
    <p>For each open disk log there is one process that handles requests 
      made to the disk log; the disk log process is created when <tt>open/1</tt>
      is called, provided there exists no process handling the disk log.
      A process that opens a disk log can either be an <em>owner</em> 
      or an anonymous <em>user</em> of the disk log. Each owner is 
      linked to the disk log 
      process, and the disk log is closed by the owner should the 
      owner terminate. Owners can subscribe to <em>notifications</em>, 
      messages of the form <tt>{disk_log, Node, Log, Info}</tt> that are sent
      from the disk log process when certain events occur, see 
      the commands below and in particular the <tt>open/1</tt> option 
      <seealso marker="#notify">notify</seealso>. 
      There can be several owners of a log, but a process cannot own a 
      log more than once. One and the same process may, however,
      open the log 
      as a user more than once. For a disk log process to properly close 
      its file and terminate, it must be closed by its owners and once by 
      some non-owner process for each time the log was used anonymously;
      the users are counted, and there must not be any users left when the
      disk log process terminates.
      </p>
    <p>Items can be logged <em>synchronously</em> by using the functions
      <tt>log/2</tt>, <tt>blog/2</tt>, <tt>log_terms/2</tt> and 
      <tt>blog_terms/2</tt>. For each of these functions, the caller is put
      on hold until the items have been logged (but not necessarily 
      written, use <tt>sync/1</tt> to ensure that). By adding an <tt>a</tt>
      to each of the mentioned function names we get functions that log
      items <em>asynchronously</em>. Asynchronous functions do not wait for
      the disk log process to actually write the items to the file, but
      return the control to the caller more or less immediately.
      </p>
    <p>When using the internal format for logs, the functions
      <tt>log/2</tt>, <tt>log_terms/2</tt>, <tt>alog/2</tt>, and
      <tt>alog_terms/2</tt> should be used. These functions log one or
      more Erlang terms. By prefixing each of the functions with
      a <tt>b</tt> (for "binary") we get the corresponding <tt>blog</tt> 
      functions for the external format. These functions log one or 
      more deep lists of bytes or, alternatively, binaries of deep lists 
      of bytes. 
      For example, to log the string <tt>"hello"</tt> in ASCII format, we
      can use <tt>disk_log:blog(Log, "hello")</tt>, or
      <tt>disk_log:blog(Log, list_to_binary("hello"))</tt>. The two
      alternatives are equally efficient. The <tt>blog</tt> functions
      can be used for internally formatted logs as well, but in
      this case they must be called with binaries constructed with
      calls to <tt>term_to_binary/1</tt>. There is no check to ensure
      this, it is entirely the responsibility of the caller. If these
      functions are called with binaries that do not correspond to
      Erlang terms, the <tt>chunk/2,3</tt> and automatic repair
      functions will fail. The corresponding terms (not the binaries)
      will be returned when <tt>chunk/2,3</tt> is called.
      </p>
    <p>A collection of open disk logs with the same name running on
      different nodes is said to be a <em>a distributed disk log</em>
      if requests made to any one of the logs are automatically made to
      the other logs as well. The members of such a collection will be
      called individual distributed disk logs, or just distributed
      disk logs if there is no risk of confusion. There is no order
      between the members of such a collection. For instance, logged
      terms are not necessarily written onto the node where the
      request was made before written onto the other nodes. One could
      note here that there are a few functions that do not make
      requests to all members of distributed disk logs, namely
      <tt>info</tt>, <tt>chunk</tt>, <tt>bchunk</tt>, <tt>chunk_step</tt> and
      <tt>lclose</tt>. An open disk log that is not a distributed disk
      log is said to be a <em>local disk log</em>. A local disk log is
      accessible only from the node where the disk log process runs,
      whereas a distributed disk log is accessible from all nodes in
      the Erlang system, with exception for those nodes where a local
      disk log with the same name as the distributed disk log exists.
      All processes on nodes that have access to a local or
      distributed disk log can log items or otherwise change, inspect
      or close the log.
      </p>
    <p>It is not guaranteed that all log files of a distributed disk log 
      contain the same log items; there is no attempt made to synchronize
      the contents of the files. However, as long as at least one of 
      the involved nodes is alive at each time, all items will be logged. 
      When logging items to a distributed log, or otherwise trying to
      change the log, the replies from individual logs are
      ignored. If all nodes are down, the disk log functions
      reply with a <tt>nonode</tt> error.
      </p>
    <note>
      <p>In some applications it may not be acceptable that
        replies from individual logs are ignored. An alternative in such
        situations is to use several local disk logs instead of one
        distributed disk log, and implement the distribution without use
        of the disk log module.</p>
    </note>
    <p>Errors are reported differently for asynchronous log attempts
      and other uses of the disk log module. When used synchronously
      the disk log module replies with an error message, but when called
      asynchronously, the disk log module does not know where to send 
      the error message. Instead owners subscribing to notifications will 
      receive an <tt>error_status</tt> message. 
      </p>
    <p>The disk log module itself does not report errors to the
      <tt>error_logger</tt> module; it is up to the caller to decide
      whether the error logger should be employed or not. The function
      <tt>format_error/1</tt> can be used to produce readable messages
      from error replies. Information events are however sent to the
      error logger in two situations, namely when a log is repaired,
      or when a file is missing while reading chunks.
      </p>
    <p>The error message <tt>no_such_log</tt> means that the given
      disk log is not currently open. Nothing is said about 
      whether the disk log files exist or not.
      </p>
    <note>
      <p>If an attempt to reopen or truncate a log fails (see
        <tt>reopen</tt> and <tt>truncate</tt>) the disk log process
        immediately terminates. Before the process terminates links to
        to owners and blocking processes (see <tt>block</tt>) are removed.
        The effect is that the links work in one direction only; any
        process using a disk log has to check for the error message
        <tt>no_such_log</tt> if some other process might truncate or
        reopen the log simultaneously.</p>

        <p>The <tt>change_size/2</tt> function changes the size of an open log. 
          For a halt log it is always possible to increase the size, 
          but it is not possible to decrease the size to something less than 
          the current size of the file.
          </p>
        <p>For a wrap log it is always possible to increase both the
          size and number of files, as long as the number of files does not 
          exceed 65000. If the maximum number of files is decreased, the
          change will not be valid until the current file is full and the 
          log wraps to the next file.
          The redundant files will be removed next time the log wraps around, 
          i.e. starts to log to file number 1.
          </p>
        <p>As an example, assume that the old maximum number of files 
          is 10 and that the new maximum number of files is 6. If 
          the current file number is not greater than the new maximum number 
          of files, the files 7 to 10 will be removed when file number 6 
          is full and the log starts to write to file number 1 again. 
          Otherwise the files greater than the current 
          file will be removed when the current file is full (e.g. if  
          the current file is 8, the files 9 and 10); the files between 
          new maximum number of files and the current 
          file (i.e. files 7 and 8) will be removed next time file number 6
          is full.
          </p>
        <p>If the size of the files is decreased the change will immediately
          affect the current log. It will not of course change the 
          size of log files already full until next time they are used.
          </p>
        <p>If the log size is decreased for instance to save space, 
          the function <tt>inc_wrap_file/1</tt> can be used to force the log 
          to wrap.

        <p>The <tt>chunk/2,3</tt> and <tt>bchunk/2,3</tt> functions make
          it possible to efficiently read the terms which have been
          appended to an internally formatted log. It minimizes disk
          I/O by reading 64 kilobyte chunks from the file. The
          <tt>bchunk/2,3</tt> functions return the binaries read from
          the file; they do not call <tt>binary_to_term</tt>. Otherwise
          the work just like <tt>chunk/2,3</tt>.
          </p>
        <p>The first time <tt>chunk</tt> (or <tt>bchunk</tt>) is called,
          an initial continuation, the atom <tt>start</tt>, must be
          provided. If there is a disk log process running on the
          current node, terms are read from that log, otherwise an
          individual distributed log on some other node is chosen, if
          such a log exists.
          </p>
        <p>When <tt>chunk/3</tt> is called, <tt>N</tt> controls the
          maximum number of terms that are read from the log in each
          chunk. Default is <tt>infinity</tt>, which means that all the
          terms contained in the 64 kilobyte chunk are read. If less than
          <tt>N</tt> terms are returned, this does not necessarily mean
          that the end of the file has been reached.
          </p>
        <p>The <tt>chunk</tt> function returns a tuple
          <tt>{Continuation2, Terms}</tt>, where <tt>Terms</tt> is a list
          of terms found in the log. <tt>Continuation2</tt> is yet
          another continuation which must be passed on to any
          subsequent calls to <tt>chunk</tt>. With a series of calls to
          <tt>chunk</tt> it is possible to extract all terms from a log.
          </p>
        <p>The <tt>chunk</tt> function returns a tuple
          <tt>{Continuation2, Terms, Badbytes}</tt> if the log is opened
          in read-only mode and the read chunk is corrupt. <tt>Badbytes</tt> 
          is the number of bytes in the file which were found not to be
          Erlang terms in the chunk. Note also that the log is not repaired.
          When trying to read chunks from a log opened in read-write mode,
          the tuple <tt>{corrupt_log_file, FileName}</tt> is returned if the
          read chunk is corrupt.
          </p>
        <p><tt>chunk</tt> returns <tt>eof</tt> when the end of the log is
          reached, or <tt>{error, Reason}</tt> if an error occurs. Should
          a wrap log file be missing, a message is output on the error log.
          </p>
        <p>When <tt>chunk/2,3</tt> is used with wrap logs, the returned
          continuation may or may not be valid in the next call to
          <tt>chunk</tt>. This is because the log may wrap and delete
          the file into which the continuation points. To make sure
          this does not happen, the log can be blocked during the
          search.

        <list type="bulleted">
          <item>
            <p><tt>{name, Log}</tt> specifies the name of the log.
              This is the name which must be passed on as a parameter in
              all subsequent logging operations. A name must always
              be supplied.
              </p>
          </item>
          <item>
            <p><tt>{file, FileName}</tt> specifies the name of the
              file which will be used for logged terms. If this value is
              omitted and the name of the log is either an atom or a string, 
              the file name will default to <tt>lists:concat([Log, ".LOG"])</tt> for halt logs. For wrap logs, this will be
              the base name of the files. Each file in a wrap log
              will be called <tt><base_name>.N</tt>, where <tt>N</tt> is an
              integer. Each wrap log will also have two files called
              <tt><base_name>.idx</tt> and <tt><base_name>.siz</tt>.

          <item>
            <p><tt>{linkto, LinkTo}</tt>.               <marker id="linkto"></marker>
If
              <tt>LinkTo</tt> is a pid, that pid becomes an owner of the
              log. If <tt>LinkTo</tt> is <tt>none</tt> the log records
              that it is used anonymously by some process by
              incrementing the <tt>users</tt> counter. By default, the
              process which calls <tt>open/1</tt> owns the log.

          <item>
            <p><tt>{repair, Repair}</tt>. If <tt>Repair</tt> is <tt>true</tt>,
              the current log file will be repaired, if needed. As the
              restoration is initiated, a message is output on the error log.
              If <tt>false</tt> is given,
              no automatic repair will be attempted. Instead, the
              tuple <tt>{error, {need_repair, Log}}</tt> is returned if an
              attempt is made to open a corrupt log file. 
              If <tt>truncate</tt> is given, the log file will
              be truncated, creating an empty log. Default is 
              <tt>true</tt>, which has no effect on logs opened in 
              read-only mode.

          </item>
          <item>
            <p><tt>{type, Type}</tt> is the type of the log. Default
              is <tt>halt</tt>.
              </p>
          </item>
          <item>
            <p><tt>{format, Format}</tt> specifies the format of the
              disk log. Default is <tt>internal</tt>. 
              </p>
          </item>
          <item>
            <p><tt>{size, Size}</tt> specifies the size of the log.
              When a halt log has reached its maximum size, all attempts to 
              log more items are rejected. The default size is 
              <tt>infinity</tt>, which for halt implies that there is no
              maximum size. For wrap logs, the <tt>Size</tt> parameter 
              may be either a pair

              latter case, if the files of an already existing wrap log
              with the same name can be found, the size is read
              from the existing wrap log, otherwise an error is returned. 
              Wrap logs write at most <tt>MaxNoBytes</tt> bytes on each file 
              and use <tt>MaxNoFiles</tt> files before starting all over with
              the first wrap log file. Regardless of <tt>MaxNoBytes</tt>,
              at least the header (if there is one) and one
              item is written on each wrap log file before
              wrapping to the next file.
              When opening an existing wrap log, it is not
              necessary to supply a value for the option <tt>Size</tt>, but any
              supplied value must equal the current size of the log, otherwise
              the tuple <tt>{error, {size_mismatch, CurrentSize, NewSize}}</tt>

        <p>The <tt>open/1</tt> function returns <tt>{ok, Log}</tt> if the
          log file was successfully opened. If the file was
          successfully repaired, the tuple <tt>{repaired, Log, {recovered, Rec}, {badbytes, Bad}}</tt> is returned, where
          <tt>Rec</tt> is the number of whole Erlang terms found in the
          file and <tt>Bad</tt> is the number of bytes in the file which
          were non-Erlang terms. If the <tt>distributed</tt> parameter
          was given, <tt>open/1</tt> returns a list of
          successful replies and a list of erroneous replies. Each
          reply is tagged with the node name.
          </p>
        <p>When a disk log is opened in read-write mode, any existing
          log file is checked for. If there is none a new empty
          log is created, otherwise the existing file is opened at the
          position after the last logged item, and the logging of items
          will commence from there. If the format is <tt>internal</tt>
          and the existing file is not recognized as an internally
          formatted log, a tuple <tt>{error, {not_a_log_file, FileName}}</tt>
          is returned.
          </p>
        <p>The <tt>open/1</tt> function cannot be used for changing the
          values of options of an already open log; when there are prior
          owners or users of a log, all option values except <tt>name</tt>, 
          <tt>linkto</tt> and <tt>notify</tt> are just checked against 
          the values that have been supplied before as option values
          to <tt>open/1</tt>, <tt>change_header/2</tt>, <tt>change_notify/3</tt>
          or <tt>change_size/2</tt>. As a consequence,
          none of the options except <tt>name</tt> is mandatory. If some
          given value differs from the current value, a tuple
          <tt>{error, {arg_mismatch, OptionName, CurrentValue, Value}}</tt> 
          is returned. Caution: an owner's attempt to open a log 
          as owner once again is acknowledged with the return value 
          <tt>{ok, Log}</tt>, but the state of the disk log is not 
          affected in any way.
          </p>
        <p>If a log with a given name is local on some node,
          and one tries to open the log distributed on the same node,
          then the tuple <tt>{error, {node_already_open, Name}}</tt> is
          returned. The same tuple is returned if the log is distributed on
          some node, and one tries to open the log locally on the same node.
          Opening individual distributed disk logs for the first time
          adds those logs to a (possibly empty) distributed disk log.
          The option values supplied are used 
          on all nodes mentioned by the <tt>distributed</tt> option. 
          Individual distributed logs know nothing
          about each other's option values, so each node can be
          given unique option values by creating a distributed
          log with several calls to <tt>open/1</tt>.
          </p>
        <p>It is possible to open a log file more than once by giving
          different values to the option <tt>name</tt> or by using the
          same file when distributing a log on different nodes.
          It is up to the user of the <tt>disk_log</tt>
          module to ensure that no more than one
          disk log process has write access to any file, or the 
          the file may be corrupted.
          </p>
        <p>If an attempt to open a log file for the first time fails, 
          the disk log process terminates with the EXIT message 
          <tt>{{failed,Reason},[{disk_log,open,1}]}</tt>.
          The function returns <tt>{error, Reason}</tt> for all other errors.
